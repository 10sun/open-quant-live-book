["io.html", "Chapter 1 I/O 1.1 Reading and Writing 1.2 Data Sources", " Chapter 1 I/O In this Chapter, we will introduce basic input and output functions in R. You will learn how to read text and excel files as well as how to read large files. We will also show how to obtain free financial and economic data from sources such as Quandl, IEX and Alpha Vantage. 1.1 Reading and Writing 1.1.1 Text Files The most basic and commonly used option to import data from text files in R is the use of the function read.table from the r-base. We can use this function to read text files with extensions such as .txt and .csv. dat.table &lt;- read.table(file = &quot;&lt;name of your file&gt;.txt&quot;) dat.csv &lt;- read.csv(file = &quot;&lt;name of your file&gt;.csv&quot;) The package readr provides functions for reading text data into R that are much faster that the functions from the r-base. The read_table function from the package readr provides a near-replacement for the read.table function. library(readr) dat.table &lt;- readr::read_table2(file = &quot;&lt;name of your file&gt;.txt&quot;) dat.csv &lt;- readr::read_csv(file = &quot;&lt;name of your file&gt;.csv&quot;) Another option to save data is to write it in rds format. Data stored in rds format has the advantage to keep the original data struture and type of the object saved. Also, .rds files are compressed and consume less space than files saved in .csv format. A data.frame object can be saved in rds format and then loaded back as follows: write_rds(dat.frame, path = &quot;&lt;name of your file&gt;.rds&quot;) dat.frame &lt;- read_rds(path = &quot;&lt;name of your file&gt;.rds&quot;) 1.1.2 Excel Files The package readxl has an ease to use interface to functions that load excel documents in R. The functions read_xls and read_xlsx can be used to read excel files as follows: library(readxl) readxl::read_xls(path = &quot;&lt;name of your file&gt;.xls&quot;) readxl::read_xlsx(path = &quot;&lt;name of your file&gt;.xlsx&quot;) The function read_excel() automatically detects the extension of the input file as follows: readxl::read_excel(&quot;&lt;name and extension of your file&gt;&quot;, sheet = &quot;&lt;sheet name or index&gt;&quot;) In the read_excel function, the sheet argument can receive either the target sheet name or index number, where sheet indexing starts at 1. The readxl has been oberving increased use compared to other comparable packages such as gdata and the xlsx due to its relative ease of use and performance. Also, the readxl do not have depency with external code libraries while the packages gdata and xlsx depend on ActiveState PERL and the Java JDK, respectively. 1.1.3 Large Files 1.2 Data Sources In this section, we will show how to obtain financial and economic data from public sources. 1.2.1 Alpha Vantage Alpha Vantage offers free access to pricing data including: Stock Time Series Data; Physical and Digital/Crypto Currencies (e.g., Bitcoin); Technical Indicators and Sector Performances. The data are available in JSON and CSV format via REST APIs. The quantmod and the alphavantager R packages offer a lightweight R interface to the Alpha Vantage API. Daily stock prices can be obtained with the quantmod::getSymbols function as follows: getSymbols(Symbols=&#39;AAPL&#39;, src=&quot;av&quot;, output.size=&quot;full&quot;, adjusted=TRUE, api.key=&#39;your API key&#39;) The output data is stored in an object with the same name as the corresponding symbol, in this example AAPL. The output data looks like this AAPL.Open AAPL.High AAPL.Low AAPL.Close AAPL.Volume AAPL.Adjusted 13.6 16.2 13.5 16.2 6411700 0.512 16.5 16.6 15.2 15.9 5820300 0.501 15.9 20.0 14.8 18.9 16182800 0.597 18.8 19.0 17.3 17.5 9300200 0.552 17.4 18.6 16.9 18.2 6910900 0.574 18.1 19.4 17.5 18.2 7915600 0.574 We called the quantmod::getSymbols function with the following arguments: Symbols='AAPL' defines a character vector specifying the names of each symbol to be loaded, here specified by the symbol of the company Apple Inc.; src=&quot;av&quot; specifies the sourcing method, here defined with the value corresponding to Alpha Vantage; output.size=&quot;full&quot;specified length of the time series returned. The strings compact and full are accepted with the following specifications: compact returns only the latest 100 data points; full returns the full-length time series of up to 20 years of historical data; adjusted=TRUE defines a boolean variable to include a column of closing prices adjusted for dividends and splits; api.key specifies your Alpha Vantage API key. 1.2.2 IEX The IEX Group operates the Investors Exchange (IEX), a stock exchange for U.S. equities that is built for investors and companies. IEX offers U.S. reference and market data including end-of-day and intraday pricing data. IEX offers an API with “a set of services designed for developers and engineers. It can be used to build high-quality apps and services”. Data sourced from the IEX API is freely available for commercial subject to conditions and the use of their API is subject to additional terms of use. IEX lists the following github project as an unofficial API for R: https://github.com/imanuelcostigan/iex. We will provide examples on how to obtain intraday pricing data using this package. First, we will use the devtools to install the package directly from its github repository as follows: library(devtools) install_github(&quot;imanuelcostigan/iex&quot;) The iex package provides 4 set of functions as follows: last: Provides IEX near real time last sale price, size and time. Last is ideal for developers that need a lightweight stock quote. IEX API real time API documentation. market: Provides exchange trade volume data in near real time. IEX market API documentation. stats: A set of functions that return trading statistics. IEX stats API documentation. tops: Provides IEX’s aggregated bid and offer position in near real time for all securities on IEX’s displayed limit order book. IEX API TOPS documentation. For instance, the last function has the following arguments: symbols: A vector of tickers (case insensitive). Special characters will be escaped. A list of eligible symbols is published daily by the IEX. When set to NULL (default) returns values for all symbols. fields: A vector of fields names to return (case sensitive). When set to NULL (default) returns values for all fields. version: The API version number, which is used to define the API URL. We can obtain intraday stock price data with the last function as follows: dat &lt;- iex::last(symbols = c(&quot;AAPL&quot;), fields = c(&quot;symbol&quot;, &quot;price&quot;, &quot;size&quot;)) The function returns an S3 object of class iex_api which has three accessible fields: path , response and content. The path contains the corresponding IEX API path: dat$path ## [1] &quot;tops/last&quot; The response contains the unparsed IEX API response: dat$response ## Response [https://api.iextrading.com/1.0/tops/last?symbols=AAPL&amp;filter=symbol%2Cprice%2Csize] ## Date: 2019-01-04 06:47 ## Status: 200 ## Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 ## Size: 45 B The content contains the parsed content from the API’s response (usually being a list). dat$content ## [[1]] ## [[1]]$symbol ## [1] &quot;AAPL&quot; ## ## [[1]]$price ## [1] 142 ## ## [[1]]$size ## [1] 100 According to the developer, this package causes R to pause 0.2 seconds after executing an API call to avoid the user being throttled by the IEX API (which enforces a 5 request per second limit). Documentation about the other set of functions can be obtained at https://github.com/imanuelcostigan/iex/tree/master/man. 1.2.3 Quandl "],

A ocorrência de eventos extremos é mais provável comparado com uma distribuição normal, i.e., as caudas da distribuição empírica de retornos são mais ``pesadas’’ comparadas com as caudas esperadas supondo uma distribuição normal de probabilidade. 2.2.2 Skewness A distribuição empírica de retornos é distorcida para esquerda. Retornos negativos são mais prováveis que retornos positivos. 2.3 Volatility \\[\\begin{equation} \\sigma = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\overline{x})^2} \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] 2.3.1 Time-invariance A volatilidade de retornos financeiros não é constante ao longo do tempo. 2.3.2 Volatility Clustering Eventos extremos são observados próximos um dos outros. 2.3.3 Correlation with Trading Volume O volume de negociação de um ativo tem correlação significante com a volatilidade do mesmo. 2.4 Correlation \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{2.2} \\rho = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{t=1}^{T} (r_t - \\hat{r}_t)(s_t - \\hat{s}_t)}{\\sqrt{\\sum\\limits_{t=1}^{T} (r_t^{\\tau} - \\hat{r}_t^{\\tau})^2}\\sqrt{\\sum\\limits_{t=1}^{T}(s_t - \\hat{s}_t)^2}}, \\end{equation}\\] onde \\(\\hat{r}_t\\) e \\(\\hat{s}_t\\) são a média amostral de \\(r_t\\) e \\(s_t\\), respectivamente. 2.4.1 Time-invariance A correlação entre duas series temporais de retornos financeiros não é constante ao longo do tempo. 2.4.2 Auto-correlation Retornos financeiros apresentam baixa autocorrelação (linear), exceto em escalas de tempo muito baixas, e.g., minutos, onde há presença de efeitos de microstructura. Por outro lado, a função de autocorrelação do valor absoluto de retornos financeiros decai lentamente com o tempo. A correlação contemporânea é maior do que a correlação cruzada. "],
