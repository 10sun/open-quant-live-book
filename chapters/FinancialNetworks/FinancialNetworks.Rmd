# Financial Networks


## Introduction

Financial markets can be regarded as a complex network in which nodes represent different financial assets and edges 
represent one or many types of relationships among those assets. 
Filtered correlation-based networks have successfully been used in the literature to study financial markets structure particularly 
from observational data derived from empirical financial time series [@bardoscia2017pathways; @10.1371/journal.pone.0017994; @Mantegna1999; @aste2010correlation; @Tumminello201040, @Tumminello26072005].
The underlying principle is to use correlations from empirical financial time series to construct a sparse network representing 
the most relevant connections.
Analyses on filtered correlation-based networks for information extraction [@song2008analysis;@aste2010correlation] 
have widely been used to 
explain market interconnectedness from high-dimensional data.
Applications include asset allocation [@LI2018; @pozzi2013spread], market stability assessments [@morales2012dynamical], 
hierarchical structure analyses [@Mantegna1999; @aste2010correlation; @Tumminello201040; @musmeci2014clustering; @song2012hierarchical] 
and the identification of lead-lag relationships [@curme2015coupled].

In this Chapter we will describe how to

* Construct and filter financial networks;
* Build price-based dynamic industry taxonomies;
* Implement a trading strategy based on financial network structure.

## Network Construction

We selected $N = 100$ of the most capitalized companies that were part of the S\&P500 index 
from 09/05/2012 to 08/25/2017. 
The list of these companies' ticker symbols is reported in the Appendix \ref{sec:comps}.
For each stock $i$ the financial variable was defined as 
the daily stock's log-return $R_i(\tau)$ at time $\tau$. 

Stock returns $R_i$ and social media opinion scores $O_i$ each amounted to a time series of length equals to 1251 trading days.
These series were divided time-wise into $M = 225$ windows $t = 1, 2, \ldots, M$
of width $T = 126$ trading days. 
A window step length parameter of $\delta T = 5$ trading days defined the displacement of the window, i.e., the number of trading days 
between two consecutive windows. The choice of window width $T$ and window step $\delta T$ is arbitrary, and
it is a trade-off between having analysis that is either too dynamic or too smooth. 
The smaller the window width and the larger the window steps, the more dynamic the data are.

To characterize the synchronous time evolution of assets, 
we used equal time Kendall's rank coefficients
between assets $i$ and $j$, defined as
\begin{equation}
 \rho_{i, j}(t) = \sum\limits_{t' < \tau}sgn(V_i(t') - V_i(\tau))sgn(V_j(t') - V_j(\tau)),
\end{equation}
where $t'$ and $\tau$ are time indexes within the window $t$ and $V_i \in \{R_i, O_i\}$.

Kendall's rank coefficients takes into account possible nonlinear (monotonic) relationships.
It fulfill the condition $-1 \leq \rho_{i, j} \leq 1$ and form the $N \times N$ correlation matrix
$C(t)$ that served as the basis for the networks constructed in this work. To construct 
the asset-based financial and social networks, we defined a distance between a pair of stocks. This
distance was associated with the edge connecting the stocks, and it reflected the level at which they were correlated.
We used a simple non-linear transformation $d_{i, j}(t) = \sqrt{2(1 - \rho_{i,j}(t))}$ to obtain distances with the
property $2 \geq d_{i,j} \geq 0$, forming a $N \times N$ symmetric distance matrix $D(t)$. 

### Network Filtering: Asset Graphs

We extract the $N(N-1)/2$ distinct distance elements from the upper triangular part of the distance matrix $D(t)$, which were then sorted in an ascending order to form an ordered sequence 
$d_1(t), d_2(t), \ldots, d_{N(N-1)/2}(t)$. Since we require the graph to be representative of the market,
it is natural to build the network by including only the strongest connections. This is a network filtering procedure that has been successfully applied in the construction of \textit{asset graphs} for the analyses of market structure \cite{1402-4896-2003-T106-011, refId0-Onnela-2004}.
The number of edges to include is arbitrary, and we included those from the bottom quartile, 
which represented the 25\% shortest edges in the graph (largest correlations), thus giving $E(t) = \{d_1(t), d_2(t), \ldots, d_{\floor{N/4}}(t)\}$.

We denoted $E^{F}(t)$ as the set of edges constructed from the distance matrix derived from 
stock returns $R(t)$. The financial network considered is $G^{F} = ( V, E^{F} )$, where $V$ is the vertex set of stocks.
