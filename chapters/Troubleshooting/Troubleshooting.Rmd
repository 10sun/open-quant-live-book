## Installing the fPortfolio R package

You may run into package dependency issues while installing the fPortfolio package. Here's a few troubleshooting tips.

### mvtnorm

You might have issues installing the package **mvtnorm** depending on your R version. If your R version is below 3.5.0, install **mvtnorm** v1.0.8 as below:
```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
install.packages("https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/mvtnorm/mvtnorm_1.0-8.tar.gz", repos=NULL)
```

### Rglpk

If you cannot install the **Rglpk** from R, first make sure you have it installed in your OS. On Ubuntu you can install it as below:
```{bash eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
sudo apt-get install glpk-utils libglpk-dev
```
