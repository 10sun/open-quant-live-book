## Submitting a Chapter

### Step 1: Fork the repo

### Step 2: Create self-contained Chapter directory

Create a self-contained folder under /Chapters with the code and markdown/Rmarkdown file of your chapter.

### Step 3: Submit pull request

One of our admins will review your pull request and build the book. The output files (html for the ebook) will be available under the directory _book. It will also be automatically available at www.ebook.openquants.com.

## If you want to build the book yourself before submitting a pull request

### Sotfware Requirements

You should install the following software:

+ Bookdown
+ R
+ R-Studio

### Getting Started

1. Fork the project or download it as a .zip file
2. Open the bookdown project on R-Studio (bookdown-demo.Rproj)
3. Open the R Markdown file index.Rmd and click the button Build Book on the Build tab of RStudio (top right-hand corner).

You can build the book as a .pdf, epub, or gitbook (renders as a web-page in the gitbook style). The output files will be available in the folder _book.

### Integrating your new Chapter into the book

After you create your folder under /Chapters with the code and markdown/Rmarkdown file of your chapter, you need to add the path to the markdown file of your Chapter to the file _bookdown.yml located in the root folder of the repo. Now when you build the book it will contain your Chapter in it.
